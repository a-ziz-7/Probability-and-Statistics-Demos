# Probabily and Statistics - Random Walks

**Description:**

This project is a Python script that provides functions for simulating two common random processes:

1. **Random Walk Simulation:** The `randomWalk` function simulates a random walk of a particle. It tracks the particle's position as it takes random steps to the left or right. The function returns the range of positions covered and the final position of the particle.

2. **Monkey and Cliff Scenario:** The `monkey_and_cliff` function models a scenario where a monkey moves along a cliff edge. The monkey starts at a given position and has a specified probability of moving toward the cliff. The simulation runs for a fixed number of seconds, and the function indicates whether the monkey survives or falls off the cliff.

3. **Gambler's Ruin Simulation:** The `gambler_ruin` function simulates a classic gambling scenario between two players, A and B. They start with initial amounts of money and take turns making bets with specified win probabilities. The simulation continues until one player goes bankrupt, and the function reports which player wins or loses.

These functions are useful for educational purposes, illustrating the behavior of random processes and stochastic simulations. The code can serve as a starting point for exploring and experimenting with random processes and basic simulations.

The project's primary goal is to provide simple tools for understanding and visualizing random processes, making it accessible for teaching and learning purposes.
